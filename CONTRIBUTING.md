# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Before you start
- Please search existing Issues and Pull Requests before opening a new one.
- If you are planning a larger change, open an Issue first to discuss scope and approach.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features
Open a GitHub Issue and include:
- expected vs. actual behavior
- steps to reproduce (minimal example preferred)
- logs/error messages and environment details (redact sensitive information)

## Pull requests
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized.
3. Update documentation if your change affects usage or behavior.

**Testing:** The project does not currently include an automated test suite. We plan to add tests in the future, and contributors are welcome (and encouraged) to include tests covering their changes where feasible.

In your PR description, please include:
- what changed and why
- how you validated the change (e.g., commands run, examples, screenshots)

**Review policy:** Pull requests into `main` require at least **one approval**, including review from the project **CODEOWNERS**, before they can be merged.

## Code style
Follow the existing style and conventions in the codebase. When in doubt, match nearby code.

## License
